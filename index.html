    <ol>
      <li>Freeze the glasses that you’ll serve the shakes in so that they stay cold and don’t melt too quickly.</li>
      <li>Allow the ice cream to soften slightly. You don’t want it runny, but allowing it to become just a little soft will help it blend easily.</li>
      <li>Add the ice cream, milk, cream and vanilla to the mixer.  Add in any fruit (strawberries!) or other mix-ins such as chocolate or caramel.</li>
      <li>Blend until smooth! We use a Ninja blender because they are strong, big and powerful</li>
    </ol>
